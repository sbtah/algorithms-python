# Understanding algorithms with Python.
Here I'm trying to implement few data structures or sorting algorithms in Python
Each implementation is tested with pytest.

## Currently implemented:
- Linked List,


## Big O Notes.
Big O is a way of comparing code efficiency mathematically.

### Time complexity.
We measure how fast is code.
Time complexity however is not measured in time. It's measured in number of operations it takes to complete something.

### Space complexity.
We measure memory usage.

### Simplify Big O notation:
1. Drop Constants
2. Drop Non-Dominants
