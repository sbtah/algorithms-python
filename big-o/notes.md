# Big O.
Big O is a way of comparing code efficiency mathematically.

## Time complexity.
We measure how fast is code.
Time complexity however is not measured in time. It's measured in number of operations it takes to complete something.

## Space complexity.
We measure memory usage.

### Simplify Big O notation:
1. Drop Constants
2. Drop Non-Dominants
