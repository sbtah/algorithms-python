# Big O of Linked Lists

## Append: O(1)
To append we need to have a last node point to new node
than tail var has to point to it also.

It doesn't matter how many items we have in linked list.
Appending always takes same number of operations.


## Removing: O(n)
We have to start from head to get to the pointer that points to value pointing to None.


## Left Append: O(1)
We set a pointer from new variable to head and head to new var.


## Left Remove: O(1)
First head pointer is moved to the next value (pointed by 1st value of head)
than 1st node is removed.


## Inserting: O(n)
